Introduction

Cryptocurrencies have gained immense popularity in recent years, with Bitcoin being the most well-known and widely used cryptocurrency. As the value of cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, predicting their prices is an important and challenging problem. Machine learning techniques have proven to be effective in predicting cryptocurrency prices, and have become increasingly popular in the field of finance. In this project, we explore the use of machine learning models to predict the price of Bitcoin. By analyzing historical data on Bitcoin prices and other relevant variables, we train and evaluate machine learning model to predict future prices of Bitcoin. Our goal is to develop accurate and reliable model that can be used to inform investment decisions in the cryptocurrency market.

Cryptocurrency Price Prediction with Machine Learning

Predicting the price of cryptocurrencies is one of the popular case in data science community. The changes in prices of stocks and cryptocurrencies not only depend on volume traded or the people who buy or sell them. They also depend on financial policies designed by the governments. The personalities who endorse a particular cryptocurrency also result in drastic changes in cryptocurrency prices.
In short, today not only buying or selling result in changes in prices but also the market sentiments and other factors. Using machine learning we can only predict the situations where price changes are due to historical prices that people see before buying or selling their cryptocurrency.
In the jupter file, I will take you through how we can predict the bitcoin prices (the king of all cryptocurrencies) for the next 30 days.
